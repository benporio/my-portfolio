                                <p>
                                    I am a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering, and also a board passer on October 2015. 
                                    My first and long career experience for about 4 years was in Media/Broadcasting Industry as a Broadcasting Technician and suddenly realized
                                    that I have to be more than who I am.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then I found myself having an interest with Programming when my girlfriend asked me for help
                                    to resolve the issues they were having with their payroll system created in Excel. I had to learn the scripting language used to create macros and automation
                                    in Excel in order to resolve those issues that are critical for their work flow.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Visual Basic for Application (VBA) is the first language I had learned but due to my limited knowledge about how coding should be done,
                                    I had just created a messy and unmanageable code. That's the point where I desired to understand the fundamentals and principles more which
                                    leads me to learn Object Oriented Programming and other concepts like design patterns and frameworks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When it comes to being a Programmer, or should I say an Aspiring and Learning Web Developer, I started this in a startup company where
                                    my older brother works in. I started to get exposed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using jQuery in this company by creating modules and addons
                                    for their web portal product. I have some git repos for these but I know there are lots of mess going around those codes. But I only work as
                                    freelance programmer in their company.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Eventually I realized that I need some passive income, this pushes me to find a full time job, and I ended up working as Junior Java Programmer in
                                    a company inside Clark Freeport Zone, Pampanga, Zgetcare Systems Inc. Their products focuses on health care system with technology stacks: JSF, Vue, 
                                    and Java Springboot and JBoss Seam framework.
